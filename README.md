   - Configured for macOS 14.0+ deployment target

2. **✅ Window Setup (Exactly like Freewrite)**
   - Borderless window with hidden title bar
   - Fixed window size (1100x600)
   - Window centering on launch
   - Fullscreen toggle functionality

   - Theme toggle button (light/dark mode)
   - Fullscreen/minimize button
   - Hover effects and cursor management

4. **✅ Basic App Structure**
   - SwiftUI App with `@main` entry point
   - ContentView with placeholder for image grid
   - Theme management with persistent preferences
   - Lato font integration (copied from Freewrite)
   - Proper file organization and project structure

## Project Structure

## Phase 2 Implementation ✅ COMPLETED

### Completed Tasks:

1. **✅ Image Grid Implementation**
   - Replaced text editor with LazyVGrid layout
   - 4-column responsive grid with 8px spacing
   - Image thumbnails with hover effects and animations
   - Click to open images in QuickLook

2. **✅ Drag & Drop Functionality**
   - Full drag & drop support for images from Finder/browser
   - Handles both URL and Data providers
   - Automatic file copying to local storage
   - Real-time grid updates

   - Persistent storage between app sessions

4. **✅ Image Management System**
   - ImageAsset model with UUID, filename, filePath, dateAdded
   - Automatic thumbnail generation

   - Hover effects with scale animations (1.05x)
   - Smooth transitions matching Freewrite's style
   - Empty state overlay (like Freewrite's placeholder)
   - Theme-aware styling

## Next Steps (Phase 3)

- Add image preview functionality
- Polish interactions and add haptic feedback
- Test and refine performance
- Package app following Freewrite's build configuration

## Running the Project

1. Open `VisualInspiration.xcodeproj` in Xcode
2. Select the VisualInspiration target
3. Build and run (⌘+R)

The app will launch with Freewrite's exact window behavior and bottom bar, ready for Phase 2 image functionality implementation.
